## Mvc Column Sort
This is just a project that spawned from frustration working with sorting in MVC and building the sort links. I never seemed to get a clean implimentation so far this has been working well.

### TODO - Column Sort Extension
* There are a couple issues I am trying to work out around other query string items and how checkboxes are used. (This is in expanded scenarios with filters - More samples to follow)

### TODO - Sample Project
* The styling of the sample needs to be cleaned up heavily I just wanted to get something up. Thinking of throwing in Twitter Bootstrap.
* Creating the sorting css styles to show the up down arrows
